_**Protobufs for functional programming**_

This is a set of libraries for deterministic binary serialization using
[strict types] &ndash; type system made with category theory which ensures
provable properties and bounds for the in-memory and serialized type representation.

The development of the libraries is performed by 
[UBIDECO Institute](https://ubideco.org).
